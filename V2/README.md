Please have patience as this repo is a work in progress.

### Model Basics

Our system incorporates a model named DisamBERT which uses BERT sentence embeddings to find similarities between author attributes and use thresholds to then join authors together that appear to be similar. You may find more information about the work in the following repo:

This repo was used to do the blocking and clustering portions of our system (seen in the modeling notebooks).
