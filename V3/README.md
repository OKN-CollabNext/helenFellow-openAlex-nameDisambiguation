# V3

Please have patience as this repo is a work in progress. All notebooks will be kept in 004 until model is deployed, at which point this repo will be reorganized into the correct directories.

### Model Basics

This model will be using outputs from our concepts (v3) and institutions (v2) models, as well as a newly created name embedding model (to be used on authors and coauthors) in order to determine if authors from 2 different works are the same person or different.

### 001_Exploration

These notebooks show code that was used to explore the author data and gather training data.

### 002_Modeling

These notebooks show code that was used to create training datasets, train the model, and test the model.

### 003_Deployment

Code used to deploy the model in AWS as an API.

### XXX_In_Progress

Live snapshot of notebooks/code that are being used to create this model. Eventually, this directory will be removed and all finalized code/notebooks will be moved into the correct directories listed above.
